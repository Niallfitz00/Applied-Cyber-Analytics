# Cyber Threat Landscape Analysis Project

## Overview

In this project, I endeavoured to dissect and understand the ever-evolving cyber threat landscape through an extensive analysis of various datasets. My primary goal was to unearth patterns and insights that could potentially aid in bolstering cybersecurity measures across different sectors. By harnessing a multitude of datasets, some of which were sourced online while others were meticulously curated by myself, I sought to create a comprehensive view of the types of cyber threats that are most prevalent today, as well as the sectors most vulnerable to these threats.

## Data Sources

The datasets utilised in this analysis include records of cyber threats, countries affected, data breaches, and a world shape dataset for geographic visualisation. These were instrumental in providing a broad perspective on cyber threats and their impacts globally. Notably, I introduced my own enhancements by exceeding the required number of datasets, thereby enriching the analysis with a deeper insight into the cyber threat landscape.

## Analysis Highlights

1. **Common Cyber Attacks**: The analysis identified DOS, Phishing, and Ransomware as the most prevalent attack types, shedding light on the primary threats in the global context.
2. **Protocol Use in Attacks**: I explored the usage of TCP and UDP protocols in cyber attacks to understand the mechanisms attackers favour, depending on their objectives.
3. **Data Breaches Over Time**: By examining the frequency and severity of data breaches over the years, I was able to identify trends and peak years of activity, thereby tracing the evolution of cybersecurity challenges.
4. **Sectors at Risk**: The project also highlighted which sectors are most frequently targeted by cybercriminals, with technology, healthcare, and finance being particularly vulnerable.
5. **Predictive Analysis**: Utilising machine learning techniques, I developed a predictive model to forecast potential future cyber attacks, enhancing our preparedness against them.
6. **Geographic Visualisation**: By combining cyber threat data with geographic information, I created an interactive map that visually represents the global distribution of cyber threats, making it easier to identify high-risk regions.

## Tools and Techniques

The project made extensive use of the R programming language and various packages such as `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `plotly`, `leaflet`, and `caret`, among others. These tools were pivotal in data manipulation, analysis, visualisation, and the creation of predictive models.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the major challenges I faced was in dealing with the vast amounts of data and ensuring its accuracy and relevance. However, this also served as a valuable learning opportunity, enhancing my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualisation. Additionally, the predictive modelling aspect introduced me to the complexities and nuances of forecasting in the realm of cybersecurity, underscoring the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in this field.

## Conclusion

This project has been a deeply enriching experience, providing me with profound insights into the cyber threat landscape. It underscored the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures and the role of data analysis in understanding and mitigating cyber threats. I hope this work contributes to the ongoing efforts in protecting against cyber threats and enhances awareness of the cybersecurity challenges we face today.
